 * PubSub beforeWrite callback

   A misleading comment about the content of the variable
   externalDataValue in the PubSub beforeWrite callback has been
   removed. Please review your beforeWrite callback implementation.
   The beforeWrite callback is called with the data pointer
   containing the data before the update. It may be used for a
   double buffer implementation.
   The original code change was done with commit
   06da5d07bd9a653d32e7a6ed06deae994d29953c.

 * Decoding variant with array of structure

   When decoding an array of structures the extension objects that
   each structure is wrapped into is now unwrapped if the array 
   contains only a single type. Previously the decoding API returned
   an array of extension objects. If the array of extension objects 
   has more than one type the decoding result will be an array of
   extension objects.

 * KeyValueMap in PubSub configuration

   The UA_KeyValueMap structure is used everywhere instead of raw
   arrays of UA_KeyValuePair.

 * Thread-safe client

   A large portion of the client API is now marked UA_THREADSAFE. For
   those methods, if multithreading is enabled, an internal mutex
   protects the client.

 * Saving unknown client certificates

   'UA_CertificateVerification_CertFolders()' has been extended with
   an additional parameter - path to the folder where the rejected
   certificate should be stored. This change applies if
   `UA_ENABLE_CERT_REJECTED_DIR` is set.

   The change was done with pull request #5260.

 * JSON decoding based on JSON5

   The JSON decoding can parse the official encoding from the OPC UA
   specification. It now further allows the following extensions:

   - The strict JSON format is relaxed to also allow the JSON5 extensions
     (https://json5.org/). This allows for more human-readable encoding
     and adds convenience features such as trailing commas in arrays and
     comments within JSON documents.
   - If `UA_ENABLE_PARSING` is set, NodeIds and ExpandedNodeIds can be given in
     the string encoding (see `UA_NodeId_parse`). The standard encoding is to
     express NodeIds as JSON objects.

   These extensions are not intended to be used for the OPC UA protocol on the
   network. They were rather added to allow more convenient configuration file
   formats that also include data in the OPC UA type system.

 * LocaleId support in the server

   The server now supports that descriptions and display names for
   different locales are written to a node. The server selects a
   suitable localization depending on the locale ids that are set for
   the current session.

   Locales are added simply by writing a LocalizedText value with a
   different locale. A locale can be removed by writing a
   LocalizedText value of the corresponding locale and with an empty
   text.

   The change was done with pull request #4165.

 * PubSub publisher id types

   The union for the PubSub publisher id 'UA_PublisherId' and
   the enumeration for the PubSub publisher type 'UA_PublisherIdType'
   have been changed to support all specified publisher id types.

   The change was done with pull request #5223.

 * PubSub state change functions

   The following functions in ua_pubsub.h have been extended with
   an additional parameter for the cause of the state change.
   Moreover the parameter order has been changed.
   UA_DataSetWriter_setPubSubState
   UA_WriterGroup_setPubSubState
   UA_DataSetReader_setPubSubState
   UA_ReaderGroup_setPubSubState

   The change was done with pull request #5162.

 * Server port and hostname configuration

   Instead of configuring the port number in the server's
   "NetworkLayer", the server configuration now takes a list of
   ServerURLs like `opc.tcp://my-server:4840` or
   `opc.wss://localhost:443`. The URLs are used both for discovery
   and to set up the server sockets based on the defined hostnames
   (and ports).

   The default is to listen on all interfaces with port 4840 for
   incoming TCP connections.

 * Empty arrays always match the array dimensions

   We consider empty arrays (also null-arrays) to have implied array
   dimensions [0,0,...]. So they always match the array dimensions
   defined in the variable. With this, the initialization of
   variables without a defined value has been simplified.
   We now create a null array if one is required.
