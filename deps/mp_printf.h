 *
 * @brief Small stand-alone implementation of the printf family of functions
 * (`(v)printf`, `(v)s(n)printf` etc., geared towards use on embedded systems with
 * a very limited resources.
 *
 * @note the implementations are thread-safe; re-entrant; use no functions from
 * the standard library; and do not dynamically allocate any memory.

/**
 * An implementation of the C standard's snprintf/vsnprintf
 *
 * This is extended for the open62541 project to take some OPC UA datatypes
 * directly with the following format specifiers:
 *
 * %S - UA_String (without wrapping in quotation marks)
 * %N - UA_NodeId (using UA_NodeId_print)
 *
 * @param s An array in which to store the formatted string. It must be large
 * enough to fit either the entire formatted output, or at least @p n
 * characters. Alternatively, it can be NULL, in which case nothing will be
 * printed, and only the number of characters which _could_ have been printed is
 * tallied and returned.
 * @param n The maximum number of characters to write to the array, including a
 * terminating null character
 * @param format A string specifying the format of the output, with %-marked
 * specifiers of how to interpret additional arguments.
 * @param arg Additional arguments to the function, one for each specifier in @p
 * format
 * @return The number of characters that COULD have been written into @p s, not
 * counting the terminating null character. A value equal or larger than @p n
 * indicates truncation. Only when the returned value is non-negative and less
 * than @p n, the null-terminated string has been fully and successfully
 * printed.
