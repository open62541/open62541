/**
 * EventLoop Plugin API
 * ====================
 * An OPC UA-enabled application can have several clients and servers. And
 * server can serve different transport-level protocols for OPC UA. The
 * EventLoop is a central module that provides a unified control-flow for all of
 * these. Hence, several applications can share an EventLoop.
 *
 * The EventLoop and the ConnectionManager implementation is
 * architecture-specific. The goal is to have a single call to "poll" (epoll,
 * kqueue, ...) in the EventLoop that covers all ConnectionManagers. Hence the
 * EventLoop plugin implementation must know implementation details of the
 * ConnectionManager implementations. So the EventLoop can extract socket
 * information, etc. from the ConnectionManagers.
 *
 * Timer Policies
 * --------------
 * A timer comes with a periodic interval in which a callback is executed. If an
 * application is congested the interval can be missed. Two different policies
 * can be used when this happens. Either schedule the next execution after the
 * interval has elapsed again from the current time onwards or stay within the
 * regular interval with respect to the original basetime. */

     * the same system are synchronized to different external master clocks.

     * independently. If the logger uses a different time domain than the

/**
 * Ethernet Connection Manager
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Listens on the network and manages UDP connections. This should be available
 * for all architectures. The configuration parameters have to set before
 * calling _start to take effect.
 *
 * **Configuration parameters for the ConnectionManager (set before start)**
 *
 * 0:recv-bufsize [uint32]
 *    Size of the buffer that is statically allocated for receiving messages
 *    (default 64kB).
 *
 * 0:send-bufsize [uint32]
 *    Size of the statically allocated buffer for sending messages. This then
 *    becomes an upper bound for the message size. If undefined a fresh buffer
 *    is allocated for every `allocNetworkBuffer` (default: no buffer).
 *
 * **Open Connection Parameters:**
 *
 * 0:listen [bool]
 *    The connection is either for sending or for listening (default: false).
 *
 * 0:interface [string]
 *    The name of the Ethernet interface to use (required).
 *
 * 0:address [string]
 *    MAC target address consisting of six groups of hexadecimal digits
 *    separated by hyphens such as 01-23-45-67-89-ab. For sending this is a
 *    required parameter. For listening this is a multicast address that the
 *    connections tries to register for.
 *
 * 0:priority [int32]
 *    Set the socket priority for sending (cf. SO_PRIORITY)
 *
 * 0:ethertype [uint16]
 *    EtherType for sending and receiving frames (optional). For listening
 *    connections, this filters out all frames with different EtherTypes.
 *
 * 0:promiscuous [bool]
 *    Receive frames also for different target addresses. Defined only for
 *    listening connections (default: false).
 *
 * 0:vid [uint16]
 *    12-bit VLAN identifier (optional for send connections).
 *
 * 0:pcp [byte]
 *    3-bit priority code point (optional for send connections).
 *
 * 0:dei [bool]
 *    1-bit drop eligible indicator (optional for send connections).
 *
 * 0:validate [boolean]
 *    If true, the connection setup will act as a dry-run without actually
 *    creating any connection but solely validating the provided parameters
 *    (default: false)
 *
 * Sending with a txtime (for Time-Sensitive Networking) is possible on recent
 * Linux kernels, If enabled for the socket, then a txtime parameters can be
 * passed to `sendWithConnection`. Note that the clock source for txtime sending
 * is the monotonic clock source set for the entire EventLoop. Check the
 * EventLoop parameters for how to set that e.g. to a PTP clock source. The
 * txtime parameters uses Linux conventions.
 *
 * 0:txtime-enable [bool]
 *    Enable sending with a txtime for the connection (default: false).
 *
 * 0:txtime-flags [uint32]
 *    txtime flags set for the socket (default: SOF_TXTIME_REPORT_ERRORS).
 *
 * **Send Parameters (only with txtime enabled for the connection)**
 *
 * 0:txtime [datetime]
 *    Time when the message is sent out (Datetime has 100ns precision) for the
 *    "monotonic" clock source of the EventLoop.
 *
 * 0:txtime-pico [uint16]
 *    Picoseconds added to the txtime timestamp (default: 0).
 *
 * 0:txtime-drop-late [bool]
 *    Drop message if it cannot be sent in time (default: true). */

/**
 * MQTT Connection Manager
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * The MQTT ConnectionManager reuses the TCP ConnectionManager that is
 * configured in the EventLoop. Hence the MQTT ConnectionManager is platform
 * agnostic and does not require porting. An MQTT connection is for a
 * combination of broker and topic. The MQTT ConnectionManager can group
 * connections to the same broker in the background. Hence adding multiple
 * connections for the same broker is "cheap". To have individual control,
 * separate connections are created for each topic and for each direction
 * (publishing / subscribing).
 *
 * **Open Connection Parameters:**
 *
 * 0:address [string]
 *    Hostname or IPv4/v6 address of the MQTT broker (required).
 *
 * 0:port [uint16]
 *    Port of the MQTT broker (default: 1883).
 *
 * 0:username [string]
 *    Username to use (default: none)
 *
 * 0:password [string]
 *    Password to use (default: none)
 *
 * 0:keep-alive [uint16]
 *   Number of seconds for the keep-alive (ping) (default: 400).
 *
 * 0:validate [boolean]
 *    If true, the connection setup will act as a dry-run without actually
 *    creating any connection but solely validating the provided parameters
 *    (default: false)
 *
 * 0:topic [string]
 *    Topic to which the connection is associated (required).
 *
 * 0:subscribe [bool]
 *    Subscribe to the topic (default: false). Otherwise it is only possible to
 *    publish on the topic. Subscribed topics can also be published to.
 *
 * **Connection Callback Parameters:**
 *
 * 0:topic [string]
 *    The value set during connect.
 *
 * 0:subscribe [bool]
 *    The value set during connect.
 *
 * **Send Parameters:**
 *
 * No additional parameters for sending over an Ethernet connection defined. */
