# open62541 nodeset Compiler

The nodeset compiler is a collection of python scripts that can parse OPC UA XML Namespace definition files and transform them into a class representation. This facilitates both reprinting the namespace in a different non-XML format (such as C-Code or DOT) and analysis of the namespace structure.

The initial implementation has been contributed by a research project of the chair for Process Control Systems Engineering of the TU Dresden. It was not strictly speaking created as a C generator, but could be easily modified to fulfill this role for open62541. Later on it was extended and improved by the core developers of open62541.
